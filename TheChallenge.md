Add instructions here for what to do.



Once you have your key, your final task is to deliver us a secret fun fact. Navigate to the [YETI Encoder/Decoder](https://tova.web.cern.ch/other/decoder.php), and use it to encode a fun fact of your choice, using your key. We'll use this same process to decode your fact, so you may want to check to make sure it worked. 

Make a PR to this repository with all the code you used for this project, and include your encoded fun fact in the description. You may want to read the bonus challenge before submitting your final code.
